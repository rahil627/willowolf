# temp web-site
yo.

welcome to willowolf (will-o'-wolf).

this site is a digital space for my (rathewolf)(https://rathewolf.com) altruistic desires: my wills, manifested digitally. It’s also spirit animal representing a will. :)

it's holds the sites of digital organizations 'n tools 'n other digital stuff i've organized/made for *the people*.

#### digital organizations
these are sites for various digital organizations i've began, each one with a specific shared interest / direction.

all should share good values: informal, *street*, *community-oriented*, *diy*, punk, *anarchist*, feminist theory, etc.

each organization derives from a will i have/had for a long period of time
- [an anarchy focused on true life](https://willowolf.com/nga), the will to research 'n develop ways to make a better world :) :)
- [an anarchy focused on experimental games](https://willowolf.com/ega), the will to research, develop, 'n love experimental games
- [an anarchy focused on fighting games](https://willowolf.com/fga), the will to research, develop, 'n love fighting games

#### notes
can keep notes that affect all of the sub-domain sites here

this part of the readme serves as a simple version of GitHub's projects 'n issues. Start with those features off (in the repo's settings), then add features as needed... but i'd prefer a simple single text file for everything.

for sites should be controlled by me (like this one), remember to keep the wiki access restricted! For sites with a public wiki, make it un-restricted. `Settings, under the Features section, un-check 'Restrict editing to collaborators only'`

in the future, when GitHub Pages isn't enough, change the DNS of the domains form using BasicDNS to my web server's DNS (Namecheap) which can be altered through cPanel. Change the `A records` back to my web host's servers, 'n build 'n deploy from my local computer (or set-up some similar way to auto-build upon git changes from my web server?).

todo:
change name in all writings  
the current image for this repo is kinda creepy...

the `host` value for DNS records are usually the sub-domain ('www') or these exceptions: '@' for no sub-domain (rathewolf.com); '*' for wild-cards (as in re-direct records)


#### discord notes
when getting the link ("invite"), you have to click on settings / edit so that you can set it to permanent. Otherwise, you'll end up linking temporary links! :/ It seems like permanent links are a character longer than temporary ones...
