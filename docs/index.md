yo.

this site contains a few wills of [rathewolf](https://rathewolf.com).

it's holds the sites of digital organizations 'n tools 'n other digital stuff i've organized/made for *the people*.

#### digital organizations
these are sites for various digital organizations i've began, each one with a specific shared interest / direction.

all should share good values: informal, *street*, *community-oriented*, *diy*, punk, *anarchist*, feminist theory, etc.

each organization derives from a will i have/had for a long period of time
- [nature's guardian anarchy: a willowolf](https://nga.willowolf.com), the will to research 'n develop ways to make a better world :) :)
- [experimental game anarchy: a willowolf](https://ega.willowolf.com), the will to research, develop, 'n love experimental games
- [fighting game anarchy: a willowolf](https://fga.willowolf.com), the will to research, develop, 'n love fighting games

once i've organized the communities, then i can begin making stuff, *together*
