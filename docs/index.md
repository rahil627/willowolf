this site is a digital space for [rathewolf](https://rathewolf.com)'s altruistic desires: my wills, manifested digitally. Itâ€™s also a spirit animal representing a single will. :)

it holds the web-sites of digital organizations, digital tools, 'n other digital stuff i've organized/made for *the people*.

- [a community that <3 experimental games](https://willowolf.com/ega), the will to organize, r&d, *play(!!!)*, 'n share our love for experimental games
- [a community that <3 fighting games](https://willowolf.com/fga), the will to organize, r&d, play, 'n share our love for fighting games


generally, all *should* share 'n uphold good values: informal, *street*, *community-oriented*, *diy*, punk, *anarchist*, feminist theory, etc.

each of these organizations derive from a specific will/desire/path/direction i have and had for a long long period of time:  
age, intense, interest:  
0-24, 21-23, experimental games  
0-22, 18-21, fighting games  
0-25, 22-24, anti-civilization  
24(?)-present, natural way of life
