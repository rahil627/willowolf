yo.

this site belongs to [rathewolf](https://rathewolf.com). At the moment, there's nothing here.

it's reserved as a home for projects that have grown beyond my control at rathewolf.com, and ready to be on it's own, with it's own name.

### archived page

this site contains a few wills of [rathewolf](https://rathewolf.com).

it's holds the sites of digital orgnaizations 'n tools i've began/made for *the people*.

#### digital organizations
these are sites for various digital organizations i've began, each one with a specific shared interest / direction.

all should share good values: community-building, diy, punk, anarchy, feminist theory, etc.

each organization derives from a will i have/had for a long period of time
- [will o' wolf of the mountains](https://mountain.willowolf.com), the will to research 'n develop ways to make a better world :) :)
- [will o' wolf of the forest](https://forest.willowolf.com), the will to research, develop, 'n love experimental games
- [will o' wolf of the desert](https://desert.willowolf.com), the will to research, develop, 'n love fighting games

once i've organized the communities, then i can begin making stuff, *together*
