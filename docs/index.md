a digital space for [rathewolf](https://rathewolf.com)'s altruistic desires: his wills, manifested digitally. Itâ€™s also a spirit animal representing a will. :) It holds the web-sites of digital organizations, digital tools, 'n other digital stuffs i've organized/made for *the people*.

#### willowolves:
[nature's guardians: *the natural way* of life](https://natural.willowolf.com/), the will to organize, r&d, 'n share our love for making ways of make a better world :) :)  
[experimental game anarchy: the art & way of experimental games](https://experimental.willowolf.com), the will to organize, r&d, *play(!!!)*, 'n share our love for experimental games  
[fighting game anarchy: the art & way of fighting games](https://fighting.willowolf.com), the will to organize, r&d, play, 'n share our love for fighting games



generally, all *should* share 'n uphold good values: informal, *street*, *community-oriented*, *diy*, punk, *anarchist*, feminist theory, grassroots-like etc.

each of these organizations derive from a specific will/desire/path/direction i have and had for a long long period of time:  
age, intense, interest:  
0-24, 21-23, experimental games  
0-22, 18-20, fighting games  
0-25, 22-24, anti-civilization^  
24-p, 27-30, natural way of life / permaculture

^my interest in anti-civilization / eco-feminism / anarchy / etc. doesn't need a comunnity. I think it's just my personal intellectual way of understanding what's exactly wrong with civilizaition (industrialized farming, urban development, cars, institutions, governments: everything), not really a practice as permaculture is. It's more of a path that led to permaculture, by rationally justifying permaculture 'n existing primitive traditional cultures.
