# the way of fighting games: an anarchy that shares interests in fighting games: a willowolf
is a digital anarchist diy community interested in the research and development of the art of fighting games

come 'n hang out at [the discord!](https://discord.gg/FtAQws9)

if that's empty, you can read 'n contribute to [the wiki](https://github.com/Rahil627/fighting-game-anarchy/wiki)

if that's not enough, you can halp make [this site](https://github.com/Rahil627/willowolf)!! The site is just as easy to edit as the wiki is. The site's source located in `docs\fga`. Just ask for permission to edit it. Sooo much to do!! :) :) Halp find or make an awesome theme. Halp transform those lists into readable tables (csv vs flat-file database). Add your own cool art 'n animation! Do what you want.
